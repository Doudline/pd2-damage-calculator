# Project Diablo 2 Damage Calculator

![](assets/showcase.png)

## Overview
This project is a graphical damage calculator for the Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction mod "Project Diablo 2". It is designed to help players optimize their builds by accurately calculating damage outputs based on in-game factors that go unreflected on the character sheet.

2nd Completed project.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): A PyQt5-based interface that allows users to select character skills, input skill levels, and choose monsters to calculate damage against.
- Damage Modifiers: Incorporates character attributes that modify skill damage such as mastery, elemental pierce and resistance break.
- Effective Damage Calculation: Automatically calculates effective damage to monsters based on skill level, monster resistances and damage modifiers.
- Modularity: Allows manual input of skill damage and monster resistances to test out hypothetical scenarios.
- (Tested on Windows only.)

All data is sourced from the game's text files.
